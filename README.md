# Ethnotekhv2_baseproject

<p>&nbsp</p>

We're getting the band back together, starting with a funded period from Creative Victoria's Creator's Fund grant program. Our aim is to research and develop audio/visual instrument concepts for VR performance.

The entire process is open-sourced, which anyone will be able to test and contribute to. Towards mid-2020, Brad and Chris will host workshops that reflect on the research period, discuss our findings, and provide a friendly introduction to using the open-source software.

This project currently does nothing. Stay tuned!
